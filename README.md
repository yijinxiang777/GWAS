# Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)

> What is GWAS?

> Things we need to learn before conducting GWAS  

1. Minor Allele Frequency (MAF)  
   * Frequency of the least often occurring allele at a specific location  
   > __Example__   
   10 individuals, freq(AA) = 6, freq(AB) = 3, freq(BB) = 1   
   freq(A) = 6*2+3/20 = 0.75 freq(B) = 5/20 = 0.25   
   MAF = freq(B) = 0.25  
   * We prefered to remove SNPs with low MAF
     1. Studies detecting the association with SNPs with a low MAP would be underpowered
     2. SNPs with low MAP are often more prine to genotyping errors
